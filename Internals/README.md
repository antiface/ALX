__Methodology Overview:__

The Creative Work-System known as "ALX" is a meticulously crafted methodology designed to integrate artistic expression and research within an interdisciplinary framework. By incorporating three primary modes of expression—Images, Sound, and Words/Text—ALX presents a rigorous approach to creativity, blending design principles with experimental techniques. Let's delve deeper into its components and application:

1. __Rigorous Design Workflow Management Methodology__:
ALX adopts a structured approach to manage the creative process, ensuring efficiency and consistency from concept to implementation. This methodology emphasizes meticulous planning and organization, essential for navigating the complexities of interdisciplinary art-research practices.

2. __Start with Noise, Modulate Noise, Modulate Relentlessly__:
Noise serves as the foundational element in ALX's creative process. The artist begins with pure randomness, employing iterative modulation techniques to gradually refine and shape the artistic output. This relentless modulation transforms chaos into order, fostering the emergence of structured and visually compelling compositions.

3. __Distributed, Iterative, Serial, Ambient, Experimental, Procedural, Generative System__:
ALX operates as a multifaceted system characterized by distributed collaboration, iterative refinement, serial progression, ambient exploration, experimental inquiry, procedural generation, and generative creativity. This comprehensive approach facilitates continuous exploration and evolution across various artistic domains.

__Integration of Research and Artistic Practice:__
- ALX transcends traditional boundaries between art and research, embodying a symbiotic relationship between creative expression and intellectual inquiry. Through meticulous documentation and archival of generated image series, the artist contributes to the accumulation of knowledge within the field of digital image processing. This interdisciplinary approach fosters innovation and insight, enriching both artistic practice and theoretical discourse.

In essence, ALX represents a paradigmatic shift in the intersection of art and research, offering a dynamic framework for exploration, experimentation, and synthesis across multiple disciplines. By embracing the inherent potential of noise and embracing a rigorous design workflow, ALX exemplifies the transformative power of interdisciplinary creativity.

### EXAMPLE OF METHOD APPLICATION:
#### An iterated, evolutionary, experimental, serial visual, digital design process:
* You start the image with a random matrix, with randomness, then you slowly go through a process of modulation in which you select branches that it is permitted to branch off into, slowly step by step selecting different possibilities for the image until you come to something which you think is visually arresting or interesting;
* Technically speaking, the image starts with pure randomness and slowly becomes less and less random and so structure or organization is created, order if you will;
* It's a form of digital morphogenesis called ["The Method of Antisynthesis or Antisynthetic Method"](https://github.com/antiface/Antisynthesis);

#### More precisely:
- Starting with a noise field that is modulated based on basic image processing functions, the artist generates a population of images and artificially selects the best images based on a fitness function;
- The "best" images are those with the highest level of visual interestingness;
- The artist generates images until he finds ones that pass the test of the fitness function;
- He then collects the most visually interesting images and bases new series on each of them, then repeats the process in an iterated manner;
- The end-result is a work of optimization of beauty in the generated series;
- As the process of selection is applied to each of the "branching", distinct series, a process of elimination takes place so that the final produce is a single image which is the "optimal solution" to the decision/design problem;
- Each series, which is a unique population of images generated procedurally, is then documented and archived, to keep a log and record of the whole art operation.

#### Evolving The Fittest Image
##### Where we speak of “populations of images”...
* I have been writing of late about my digital image processing practise, which is still young in terms of years. What I want to do here is discuss the more “Global” picture of what I’m trying to do with image processing in general.
* It might be best to just speak of “populations” of images, rather than images in the particular. I have already mentioned that I begin each image with pure noise. I start with basic “data” which I call noise, as “initial conditions”, and then “evolve” the images through the use of primitive image processing operations/functions. What I want to describe, though, is how each image is just an “instance” of a “possible image”, a kind of imagistic “potential”.
* That is to say, as soon as I start with some noise, there are a near-infinite number of ways that the image can end up. If I only use simple functions/operations, then I myself can only “evolve” each image “so far”, since I must terminate at some point in time. I only have limited time and space resources, so I can only go “so far”. But even if there are “finite” possibilities for each image, there are still countless numbers of ways in which they might end up.
* It is this vast “sea of possible images” that I want to speak about today. Each image is an “instance” of the “image potential” of each procedural noise texture that I start with as initial data/initial conditions. I use an “experimental” method of investigation in my image processing work. I am investigating, researching the many ways in which I can “modulate noise” to create digital images with some level of “interestingness”. Here is an example of something I did today:
* I literally start “from nothing”, a.k.a. “ex nihilo”. I “seed” the image file, that is, I generate some “noise” procedurally. In this case, I only used various “scaling” functions, i.e. I used various layers and also used the “difference blend mode” on them, and all were based on “pixelated” variations on the initial “noise conditions”.
* With nothing but layers of noise, pixelization and the Difference blend mode, I was able to “generate” the image you see above. But I also generated a good hundred other images. Since I began making digital images this way, I have amassed thousands of these little images, which is why I speak now of a great “population” of images.
* The idea is to produce the “best image”. It really IS survival of the fittest for my little images. It might be interesting to remind the reader that a digital image to me is nothing more than a simple MATRIX, a two-dimensional matrix, a bitmap (even though I am using the JPEG compression algorithm). What that means is that I start with a 512 pixel by 512 pixel image in which each pixel is a random value. I try to use pure Gaussian noise, but am trying to experiment with other kinds or colors of noise.
* To me an image is just a “distribution of pixels”, that is, it is a 2D matrix of pixels with a “distribution” of values for each pixel. That is how I treat each and every image, and my goal is to get the “fittest distribution”, the one that has the greatest “visual appeal”, or what I am calling visual “interestingness”.
* Here above is another “variation” on the original series/sequence I started earlier today, or one of the series I worked on today (note: There are many series). If you wanted to, you could take both images I have posted above and analyze them numerically and see that they are actually variations on one another. They both come from the same “seed” and that could potentially be explained mathematically, though I myself lack the discipline. I just know they are in the same series because I generated them myself and have “named” them in consequence.
* So in other words, these two images above are “samples” from today’s “run” of the genetic algorithm of image processing that I am using. It is an “interactive” genetic algorithm because I am using my own human senses at the moment to “evaluate” and “select” each image. I “evaluated” and “selected” these two from the ongoing series, which had many false starts and stops.
* I work in an “iterated” manner, going image after image, modulation by modulation, transformation by transformation, towards “the fittest image”.
