### METHODOLOGY:
* Rigorous design practice;
* Rigorous workflow management methodologies;
* Rigorous work, from design concept to implementation;
* Instances of design objects, learning objects;
* Workflow methodology working with management of design artefacts;
* Noise is used as input to most functions;

### EXAMPLE OF METHOD APPLICATION:
#### An iterated, evolutionary, experimental, serial visual, digital design process:
* You start the image with a random matrix, with randomness, then you slowly go through a process of modulation in which you select branches that it is permitted to branch off into, slowly step by step selecting different possibilities for the image until you come to something which you think is visually arresting or interesting;
* Technically speaking, the image starts with pure randomness and slowly becomes less and less random and so structure or organization is created, order if you will;
* It's a form of digital morphogenesis;

#### More precisely:
- Starting with a noise field that is modulated based on basic image processing functions, the artist generates a population of images and artificially selects the best images based on a fitness function;
- The "best" images are those with the highest level of visual interestingness;
- The artist generates images until he finds ones that pass the test of the fitness function;
- He then collects the most visually interesting images and bases new series on each of them, then repeats the process in an iterated manner;
- The end-result is a work of optimization of beauty in the generated series;
- As the process of selection is applied to each of the "branching", distinct series, a process of elimination takes place so that the final produce is a single image which is the "optimal solution" to the decision/design problem;
- Each series, which is a unique population of images generated procedurally, is then documented and archived, to keep a log and record of the whole art operation.
