### METHODOLOGY:
* Rigorous design practice;
* Rigorous workflow management methodologies;
* Rigorous work, from design concept to implementation;
* Instances of design objects, learning objects;
* Workflow methodology working with management of design artefacts;
* Noise is used as input to most functions;

### EXAMPLE OF METHOD APPLICATION:
* You start the image with a random matrix, with randomness, then you slowly go through a process of modulation in which you select branches that it is permitted to branch off into, slowly step by step selecting different possibilities for the image until you come to something which you think is visually arresting or interesting;
* Technically speaking, the image starts with pure randomness and slowly becomes less and less random and so structure or organization is created, order if you will;
* It's a form of digital morphogenesis;
